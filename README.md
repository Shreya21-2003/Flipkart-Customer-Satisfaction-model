# Customer Satisfaction Score Prediction
A machine learning project to predict Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Scores using classification models and feature importance analysis. This project involves EDA, data preprocessing, handling imbalanced data, and building ML models for accurate CSAT prediction.

Steps Performed-
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2. Visualizations: Bar, Pie, Count, Box, Histogram, Strip, Violin, Area, Heatmap, and Line plots.

3. Insights gathered on data distribution, trends, and relationships.

4 Data Preprocessing

5. Scaling, handling missing values, and outlier treatment.

6. Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.

7. Model Building-

Models used:

1.Logistic Regression
2.Random Forest
3.XGBoost (Final model)

8. Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

Model Explainability

Used SHAP to interpret feature importance and explain model behavior.

ðŸš€ Final Model
XGBoost Classifier
Best performance on metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, and Recall.
Explained predictions using SHAP for transparency.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
Certain customer attributes significantly impact CSAT Scores.
Handling imbalanced data and outliers is crucial for model accuracy.
SHAP values provide clear explanations of model predictions for business stakeholders.

ðŸ’¡ Business Impact
This predictive model helps businesses:
âœ… Identify factors contributing to customer satisfaction.
âœ… Predict customer dissatisfaction proactively.
âœ… Focus on improving key areas to boost customer experience.
